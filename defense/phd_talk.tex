%% (5-10min)  1. What is the problem: motivation, definition, related work
%% (5-10min)  2. What results do you have: approximation ratio
%% (30-40min) 3. How did you solve it: techniques
%% (5min)     4. How to improve it: open problems, future work

%% 1. What is the problem: motivation, definition, related work
%% - motivation: ISP/residents, data center/consumer
%% - definition: F, C, r_j, d_ij, f_i, what is a solution and what is the cost
%% - related work: UFL and FTFL

%% 2. Results: 1.575 rounding, hard example on dual-fitting

%% 3. Techniques:
%% 3.1 Demand Reduction: why, what (end product) and how (take floor)
%%     implication: reduction to FTFL, 1 + O(m/Q) approximation
%% 3.2 Adaptive Partitioning: why, what and how
%%     why: to use UFL-like rounding
%%     what: facility points and unit demand points, \barx and \bary with mu and nu
%%           properties...
%%     how: unit chunk, best client, primary, non-primary, overlap of neighborhood
%%
%% 3.3 Rounding: fault-tolerant made easy, all ratios preserved
%%     the 1.575 rounding is subtle
%% 3.4 Greedy, Dual-fitting, and hard example for local-charging

%% 4. Open problems and future work
%%     - dual-fitting for FTFP
%%     - 1.463 for UFL
