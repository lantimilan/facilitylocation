This is an example showing partition algorithm. There are
$4$ sites and $4$ cliens. All sites have facility opening
cost $f_i=1$ for $i=1,2,3,4$. All $d_{ij}=1$ except $d_{11}
= d_{22} = d_{33} = d_{44} = 3$. The demands are $r_1=1,
r_2=r_3=r_4=2$.

Solving the LP, we obtain fractional solution

  \begin{subtable}{0.5\textwidth}

  \begin{tabular}{c | c c c c}
    $y_i^\ast$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
    \hline
    & 4/3 & 1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3\\

    $x_{ij}^\ast$ & $j=1$ & 2 & 3 & 4\\

    $i=1$ & 0 & 4/3 & 4/3 & 4/3\\
    2 & 1/3 & 0 & 1/3 & 1/3\\
    3 & 1/3 & 1/3 & 0 & 1/3\\
    4 & 1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3 & 0\\

It is easily seen that the fractional solution above is
optimal and complete. The dual optimal solution has all
$\alpha_j^\ast = 4/3$ for $j=1,2,3,4$. Now we perform the
adaptive partition algorithm, consisting of two
phases. Phase 1, the partition phase has 2 iterations. In
the first iteration we might pick client $1$ and create a
primary demand $\kappa_{11}$ for it. All other clients have
their $\wtildeN(j)$ overlaps with $\wbarN(\kappa_{11})$, so
each of client $2,3$ and $4$ has a demand created and
assigned to $\kappa_{11}$. In iteration 2, we pick client
$4$ and create a primary demand $\kappa_{42}$, each of
client $2$ and $3$ has one demand created and assigned to
$\kappa_{42}$. Now all clients are exhausted and we simply
perform Phase 2, the augmenting phase to make all demands
each having total connection value equal to 1. The final
fractional solution is given below. It can be verified that
all the stated properties are satisfied.
