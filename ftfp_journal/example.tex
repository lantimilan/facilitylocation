This is an example showing partition algorithm. There are $4$ sites
and $4$ cliens. All facilities have opening cost $f_i=1$ for
$i=1,2,3,4$. All $d_{ij}=1$ except $d_{14} = d_{21} = d_{32} = d_{43}
= 3$. The demands are $r_1=1, r_2=r_3=r_4=2$.

Solving LP, we obtain fractional solution

    $y_i^\ast$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\

    2 & 1/3 & 1/3 & 0   & 1/3\\

The dual optimal solution has all $\alpha_j^\ast = 4/3$ for
$j=1,2,3,4$. It is easily seen that the fractional solution above is
optimal and complete. Now we perform the adaptive partition
algorithm. In the first iteration we might pick client $1$ and create
a primary demand $\nu_{11}$ for it. All other clients have their
$\wtildeN(j)$ overlaps with $\wbarN(\nu_{11})$, so each of client
$2,3$ and $4$ has a demand created and assigned to $\nu_{11}$. In
iteration 2, we pick client $4$ and create a primary demand
$\nu_{42}$, each of client $2$ and $3$ has one demand created and
assigned to $\nu_{42}$. Now all clients are exhausted and we simply
perform the augmenting phase to make all demands having total
connection value equal to 1. The final fractional solution is given
below. It can be verified that all the stated properties are
satisfied.
