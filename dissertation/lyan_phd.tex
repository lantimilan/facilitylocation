\begin{abstract}
  The dissertation concerns the fault-tolerant facility placement
  problem (FTFP), a variant of the well-known uncapacitated facility
  location problem (UFL). The result was mostly on the approximation
  algorithms and their performance guarantee. It is easily seen that
  FTFP is a generalization of UFL. In this thesis we show that several
  techniques that have been applied in the UFL problem can be
  generalized to the FTFP problem with good approximation results.

\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch: intro}

\section{The Problem and the Background}
The facility location problems (FL) is about selecting a set of
candidate places to build facilities and connecting clients to the
facilities to satisfy their demands. It models real world scenarios
like setting up warehouses to deliver commodities to retailers,
building power suppliers to serve the needs of a district of
residents, placing content servers in a network to send files to
clients. This simple model has been an active topic in both operations
research and computer science since 1960s, and a number of algorithm
design techniques have been found applicable in obtaining solutions
with desired properties.

There are over a dozen different variation in the problem formulation,
and the uncapacitated facility location problem (UFL) concerns the
simpliest model where each candidate facility has an opening cost and
the connection cost between a client and a facility is the distance
between the two. Each client needs to be connected to one open
facility. A solution consists of a set of facilities to open and a
specification of connections for each client to an open facility. The
cost of the solution is simply the sum of facility opening cost and
the connection cost to connect every client to some open facility. The
UFL problem asks for a solution with minimum cost.

The problem studied in this thesis is a generalization of the UFL
problem, in that each client may specify a demand and the client then
needs to be connected to several different facilities with the number
of connections equal to its demand.  A solution consists of a
specification of the number of facilities to open in each site, and
the connection between clients and sites. Open multiple facilities in
the same site incurs a cost of the opening cost for this site the same
number of times, and the connection cost between a site and a client
is the number of connections times the distance between the two, with
the constaint that the number of connections cannot exceed the number
of facilities opened in that site. The FTFP problem asks for a
solution with minimum cost.

\section{Notation and Definition}
We denote the set of sites as $\sitesset$ and the set of clients as
$\clientset$. Each client $j \in \clientset$ has a demand $r_j$,
meaning the client $j$ needs to be connected to $r_j$ different
facilities. To open one facility at site $i$ incurs a cost of
$f_i$. To make one connection from client $j$ to a facility at site
$i$ incurs a cost of $d_{ij}$. The problem asks for a vector of
$(\bfx, \bfy)$ such that $x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}$ denotes the number of
connections between site $i$ and client $j$, and $y_i \in \{0, 1\}$
denotes the number of facilities opened at site $i$. We then seek a
solution such that $y_i \geq x_{ij}$ for every $i \in \sitesset, j \in
\clientset$ and $\sum_{i\in\sitesset} x_{ij} \geq r_j$ for all clients
$j \in \clientset$, and we are to minimize the total cost of the
solution, which is $\sum_{i \in \sitesset} f_i y_i + \sum_{i \in
  \sitesset, j \in \clientset} d_{ij} x_{ij}$. We call $\sum_{i \in
  \sitesset} f_i y_i$ the facility cost of a solution and $\sum_{i \in
  \sitesset, j \in \clientset} d_{ij} x_{ij}$ the connection cost of a
solution $(\bfx, \bfy)$.

\section{The Notion of P vs NP, Approximation}
Both the UFL problem and the FTFP problem are easily seen to be
NP-hard, as they contain the Set Cover problem as a special case. The
Set Cover problem is that, given a universe $\calU = \{e_1,
\ldots, e_n\}$ and a collection of subsets $\calS = \{S_1,
\ldots, S_m\}$ such that $S_l \leq U$ for $l=1,\ldots,m$, find a
minimum number of sets in $\calS$ to cover all elements in
$\calU$. It is well-known that the Set-Cover problem is NP-hard.

Question: Why is metric UFL NP-hard, or even more so, APX-hard?

Every dissertation should have an introduction.  You might not realize
it, but the introduction should introduce the concepts, backgrouand,
