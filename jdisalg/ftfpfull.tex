\begin{abstract} 
  The Fault-Tolerant Facility Placement problem (FTFP) is a
  generalization of the classic Uncapacitated Facility
  Location Problem (UFL). In FTFP we are given a set of
  facility sites and a set of clients. Opening a facility at
  site $i$ costs $f_i$ and connecting client $j$ to a
  facility at site $i$ costs $d_{ij}$. We assume that the
  connection costs (distances) $d_{ij}$ satisfy the triangle
  inequality. Multiple facilities can be opened at any
  site. Each client $j$ has a demand $r_j$, which means that
  it needs to be connected to $r_j$ different facilities
  (some of which could be located on the same site). The
  goal is to minimize the sum of facility opening cost and
  connection cost.

  The main result of this paper is a $1.575$-approximation algorithm
  for FTFP, based on LP-rounding. The algorithm first reduces the
  demands to values polynomial in the number of sites. Then it uses a
  technique that we call adaptive partitioning, which partitions the
  instance by splitting clients into unit demands and creating a
  number of (not yet opened) facilities at each site. It also
  partitions the optimal fractional solution to produce a fractional
  solution for this new instance.  The partitioned fractional solution
  satisfies a number of properties that allow us to exploit existing
  LP-rounding methods for UFL to round our partitioned solution to an
  integral solution, preserving the approximation ratio.  In
  particular, our $1.575$-approximation algorithm is based on the
  ideas from the $1.575$-approximation algorithm for UFL by
  Byrka~\etal, with changes necessary to satisfy the fault-tolerance
  requirement.

\section{Final Comments}

In this paper we show a sequence of LP-rounding approximation algorithms
for FTFP, with the best algorithm achieving  ratio $1.575$. 
As we mentioned earlier, we believe that 
our techniques of demand reduction and adaptive partitioning are very flexible and
should be useful in extending other LP-rounding methods for UFL to obtain
matching bounds for FTFP.

One of the main open problems in this area is whether FTFL can be approximated with the
same ratio as UFL, and our work was partly motivated by this question. The techniques we
introduced are not directly applicable to FTFL, mainly because our partitioning
approach involves facility splitting that could result in several sibling demands being served
by facilities on the same site. Nonetheless, we hope that further refinements of 
our construction might get around this issue and
lead to new algorithms for FTFL with improved ratios.
